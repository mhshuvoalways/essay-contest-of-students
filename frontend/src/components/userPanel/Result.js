            weapon to improve one’s life. It is probably the most important tool
            to change one’s life. Education for a child begins at home. It is a
            lifelong process that ends with death. Education certainly
            determines the quality of an individual’s life. Education improves
            one’s knowledge, skills and develops the personality and attitude.
            Most noteworthy, Education affects the chances of employment for
            people. A highly educated individual is probably very likely to get
            a good job. In this essay on importance of education, we will tell
            you about the value of education in life and society Importance of
            Education in Life First of all, Education teaches the ability to
            read and write. Reading and writing is the first step in Education.

            Education makes people literate. Above all, Education is extremely
            important for employment. It certainly is a great opportunity to
            make a decent living. This is due to the skills of a high paying job
            that Education provides. Uneducated people are probably at a huge
            disadvantage when it comes to jobs. It seems like many poor people
            improve their lives with the help of Education. Better Communication
            is yet another role in Education. Education improves and refines the
            speech of a person. Furthermore, individuals also improve other
            means of communication with Education. Education makes an individual
            a better user of technology. Education certainly provides the
            technical skills necessary for using technology. Hence, without
            Education, it would probably be difficult to handle modern machines.
            People become more mature with the help of Education. Sophistication
            enters the life of educated people. Above all, Education teaches the
            value of discipline to individuals. Educated people also realize the

            efficiently. Educated individuals can explain their opinions in a
            clear manner. Hence, educated people are quite likely to convince
            people to their point of view.
